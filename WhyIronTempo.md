# Why Tempo Matters in Gym Workouts

Tempo = speed of each rep phase:
Eccentric (down) – Pause – Concentric (up) – Pause
Example: 3-1-2-0 = 3s down, 1s pause, 2s up, 0s top.

## Benefits
- **More Muscle**: ↑ Time under tension → hypertrophy
- **Better Form**: Slow reps = safer, stricter
- **Smarter Gains**: Target fast-twitch (explosive) or slow-twitch (endurance)
- **Break Plateus**: New stimulus without heavier weights

IronTempo keeps you honest. No more rushing reps.
